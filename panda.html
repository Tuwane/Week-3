<h3>PANDAS</h3>
The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) also known as panda bear or simply panda, </p>
<p>is a bear native to south central China. </p>
<p>It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes,</p>
<p> over the ears, and across its round body. </p>
<p>The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the unrelated red panda.</p>
<p>Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo. </p>
</p>Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other </p>
<p>grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents or carrion. </p>
<p>In captivity, they may receive </p>
honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.

The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central </p>
<p>China, mainly in Sichuan province, but also in neighbouring provinces, namely </p>
<p>Shaanxi and Gansu. As a result of farming, deforestation, and other </p>
<p>development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived.</p>

<p>The giant panda is a conservation reliant endangered species.</p>

<p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p>

<p>You will find the pandas at Panda Canyon.</p>
