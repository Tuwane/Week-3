<h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
<p>The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is an African even-toed ungulate mammal,</p>
<p>the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. </p>
<p>Its species name refers to its camel-like shape and its leopard-like colouring. </p>
<p>Its chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and </p>
<p>legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns. </p>
<p>It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along </p>
<p>with its closest extant relative, the okapi. </p>
<p>The nine subspecies are distinguished by their coat patterns.</p>

<p>The giraffe's scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in </p>
<p>the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east.</p>
<p>Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs, grasslands, and open woodlands. </p>
<p.Their primary food source is acacia leaves, which </p>
<p>they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach.</p>

<p>Giraffes are preyed on by lions; their calves are also targeted by </p>
<p>leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs. </p>
<p.Adult giraffes do not have strong social bonds, though </p>
<p>they do gather in loose aggregations if they happen to be moving in </p>
<p>the same general direction. Males establish social hierarchies</p>
<p>through "necking", which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon.</p>
<p>Dominant males gain mating access to females, which </p>
<p>bear the sole responsibility for raising the young.</p>

<p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p>

<p>You will find the giraffes at G15, just beyond the research centre.</p>
