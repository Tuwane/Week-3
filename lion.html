<h3>LION</h3>
<p>The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the five big cats in the genus Panthera and a member of the family Felidae. </p>
<p>The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies found in Africa. </p>
<p>With some males exceeding 250 kg (550 lb) in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger.</p>

<p>Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in </p>
<p>Asia (where an endangered remnant population resides in </p>
<p>Gir Forest National Park in India) while other types of lions </p>
<p>have disappeared from North Africa and Southwest Asia in historic times. </p>
<p>Until the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, </p>
<p>the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans.</p>
<p>They were found in most of Africa, across Eurasia from western Europe to India, </p>
</p>and in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru.</p>

<p>The lion is a vulnerable species, </p>
<p>having seen a major population decline in its </p>
<p>African range of 30 to 50% per two decades during the second half of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. </p>
<p>Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, </p>
<p>habitat loss and conflicts with humans are currently the greatest causes of concern. </p>
<p>Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.</p>

<p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p>

<p>You will find the lions at the Northern Frontier</p>
