<h3>KOALA</h3>
<p>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus, or, inaccurately, </p>
<p>koala bear[a]) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. </p>
<p>It is the only extant representative of the family </p>
<p>Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats. </p>
<p>The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting </p>
<p>Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. </p>
<p>It is easily recognisable by its stout, </p>
<p>tailless body and large head with round, </p>
<p>fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. </p>
<p>The koala has a body length of 60 to 85cm (24 to 33 in) and weighs 4 to 15 kg (9 to 33 lb).</p>
<p>Pelage colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. </p>
<p>Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in </p>
<p>colour than their counterparts further south. </p>
<p>These populations possibly are separate subspecies, but this is disputed.</p>

<p>Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. </p>
<p>Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, </p>
<p>koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day.</p>
<p>They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. </p>
<p>Adult males communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. </p>
<p>Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests. </p>
<p>Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl </p>
<p>into their mothers' pouches, where they stay for the first six to seven months of their lives. </p>
<p>These young koalas, known as joeys, are fully weaned around a year old. </p>
<p>Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, </p>
<p>but are threatened by various pathogens, </p>
<p>such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala retrovirus, as well as by bushfires and droughts.</p>

<p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p>

<p>You will find the koalas next to the giraffe enclosure.</p>
