<h3>ELEPHANTs</h3>
<p>Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. </p>
<p>Two species are traditionally recognised, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and </p>
<p>the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). </p>
<p>Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p> Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrial</p>
<p> animals and can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb).</p><br>

<p>All elephants have several distinctive features the </p>
<p>most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used </p>
<p>for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water and grasping objects.</p>
<p>Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as </p>
<p>weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. </p>
<p>Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. </p>
<p>Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. </p>
<p>African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while</p>
<p>Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p><br>

<p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats</p>
<p>including savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.</p>

<p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p>
<br>
<p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
