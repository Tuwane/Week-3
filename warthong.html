<h3>WARTHOG</h3>
<p>Phacochoerus is a genus of wild pigs in the family Suidae, known as warthogs. </p>
<p>It is the sole genus of subfamily Phacochoerinae. </p>
<p>They are found in open and semiopen habitats, even in quite arid regions, in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>The two species were formerly considered conspecific under the </p>
<p>scientific name Phacochoerus aethiopicus, but </p>
<p>today this is limited to the desert warthog, while </p>
<p>the best-known and most widespread species, the common warthog (or simply warthog) is Phacochoerus africanus.</p>

<p>Although covered in bristly hairs, their </p>
<p>bodies and heads appear largely naked from a </p>
<p>distance, with only the crest along the back, and the tufts on their </p>
<p>cheeks and tails being obviously haired. </p>
<p>The English name refers to their facial wattles, which are particularly distinct in males.</p>
<p>They also have very distinct tusks, which reach a length</p>
<p>of 25.5 to 63.5 cm (10.0 to 25.0 in) in the males, but are always smaller in the females. </p>
<p>They are largely herbivorous, but occasionally also eat small animal food. </p>
<p>While both species remain fairly common and widespread, and </p>
<p>therefore are considered to be of Least </p>
<p>Concern by the IUCN, the nominate subspecies of the desert </p>
<p>warthog, commonly known as the Cape warthog, became extinct around 1865.</p>

<p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p>

<p>You will find the warthogs at WA11, near the elephant enclosure.</p>
